## ‚ùó Open Bugs / UX Issues

| ID | Title | Symptoms / Screenshots | Suspected Root Cause |
|----|-------|------------------------|----------------------|
| FEED-01 | Feed avatars & profile names missing | User metadata shows "Loading‚Ä¶" forever; avatar circles stay black | Nostr metadata event (kind 0) not arriving / subscription not set on remount |
| FEED-02 | Feed doesn't reload after navigating away | Returning from another tab shows perpetual "Loading posts‚Ä¶" | Relay subscription is torn down on unmount and not re-established; local state stuck in `loading=true` |
| FEED-03 | Manual refresh button does nothing | ‚Üª icon performs no action | Button wired to stale handler; redundant once FEED-02 fixed |
| FEED-04 | Feed sometimes blank on first load | Occasional empty state until app restart | Race condition or relay connection delay; no local cache fallback |
| CACHE-01 | No local/offline cache for posts | Switching tabs or offline drops feed | Missing IndexedDB / localStorage layer |
| MUSIC-01 | "Liked Songs" playlist won't play | Tapping play does nothing | Selected playlist not passed to player context; track URLs missing |
| MUSIC-02 | Music player unstable / sketchy | Playback controls intermittently unresponsive | Event listeners duplicated between floating & header players |
| WORKOUT-01 | Caloric calculation errors on post | Workout posts succeed but server returns kcal error | API expects `intensity` or `MET` parameter that UI doesn't supply |
| ICON-01 | Launcher icon shows black corners | White circle with dark fringe on homescreen | Adaptive-icon foreground layer not sized to 108√ó108dp |

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Road-map (Easiest ‚ûú Hardest)

1. **Remove / disable dead Feed refresh button (FEED-03)**  
   ‚Äì Pure UI change; one component edit.

2. **Fix launcher adaptive icon asset (ICON-01)**  
   ‚Äì Replace foreground PNG / XML mask; no code.

3. **Ensure Feed re-subscribes on remount (FEED-02)**  
   ‚Äì Move Nostr subscription to global store or use `useEffect` with dependency on `isMounted`.

4. **Load user metadata reliably (FEED-01)**  
   ‚Äì Confirm kind 0 subscription; add fallback request; ensure avatars fade-in.

5. **Local cache layer for posts (CACHE-01, supports FEED-04)**  
   ‚Äì Use IndexedDB via `idb-keyval` or React Query `persistor`.

6. **Small music fixes**  
   a. Link "Liked Songs" playlist to player context (MUSIC-01).  
   b. Audit player event listeners for duplication (MUSIC-02).

7. **Workout post kcal / intensity (WORKOUT-01)**  
   ‚Äì Add intensity selection UI (1‚Äì10) ‚Üí send with POST payload; adjust server calc.

8. **Optional refinements & polish**  
   ‚Äì Remove manual refresh button entirely after auto-reload + cache proved stable.  
   ‚Äì Implement Service Worker for full offline support.
