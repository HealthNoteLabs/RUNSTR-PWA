## ‚ùó Open Bugs / UX Issues

| ID | Title | Symptoms / Screenshots | Suspected Root Cause |
|----|-------|------------------------|----------------------|
| RUN-01 | Split time shown in decimal minutes | Splits like "8.85 minutes" instead of "8:51" | Formatting util converts seconds ‚Üí minutes as float, not `mm:ss` string |
| RUN-02 | Personal-best 5 k pace absurd | Stats page shows PB 5k as `2431:06 min/mi` | Distance units mix-up: total seconds √∑ *meters* ‚Üí huge value |
| STREAK-01 | Streak counter & sats reward fail | Ran 2 days; Settings shows streak 0, no Lightning sent | Streak calculation ignores most-recent run; payout trigger not fired |
| NOSTR-02 | Red-box error after posting run | RN red screen right after "Run posted" toast | Callback in Nostr publish flow throws when splits array undefined |
| FEED-01 | Feed avatars & profile names missing | User metadata shows "Loading‚Ä¶" forever; avatar circles stay black | Nostr metadata event (kind 0) not arriving / subscription not set on remount |
| FEED-02 | Feed doesn't reload after navigating away | Returning from another tab shows perpetual "Loading posts‚Ä¶" | Relay subscription is torn down on unmount and not re-established; local state stuck in `loading=true` |
| FEED-03 | Manual refresh button does nothing | ‚Üª icon performs no action | Button wired to stale handler; redundant once FEED-02 fixed |
| FEED-04 | Feed sometimes blank on first load | Occasional empty state until app restart | Race condition or relay connection delay; no local cache fallback |
| CACHE-01 | No local/offline cache for posts | Switching tabs or offline drops feed | Missing IndexedDB / localStorage layer |
| MUSIC-01 | "Liked Songs" playlist won't play | Tapping play does nothing | Selected playlist not passed to player context; track URLs missing |
| MUSIC-02 | Music player unstable / sketchy | Playback controls intermittently unresponsive | Event listeners duplicated between floating & header players |
| WORKOUT-01 | Caloric calculation errors on post | Workout posts succeed but server returns kcal error | API expects `intensity` or `MET` parameter that UI doesn't supply |
| ICON-01 | Launcher icon shows black corners | White circle with dark fringe on homescreen | Adaptive-icon foreground layer not sized to 108√ó108dp |

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Road-map (Easiest ‚ûú Hardest)

1. **Format run splits as mm:ss (RUN-01)**  
   ‚Äì Pure formatting fix in util; unit test.
2. **Fix 5 km PB pace calculation (RUN-02)**  
   ‚Äì Correct distance/time unit math; update stats selector.
3. **Repair streak counter & sats reward (STREAK-01)**  
   ‚Äì Audit streak algorithm; ensure Lightning payout on streak increment.
4. **Investigate red-box after Nostr post (NOSTR-02)**  
   ‚Äì Reproduce and capture stack trace; fix null-split handling.
5. **Remove / disable dead Feed refresh button (FEED-03)**  
   ‚Äì Pure UI change; one component edit.
6. **Fix launcher adaptive icon asset (ICON-01)**  
   ‚Äì Replace foreground PNG / XML mask; no code.
7. **Ensure Feed re-subscribes on remount (FEED-02)**  
   ‚Äì Move Nostr subscription to global store or use `useEffect` with dependency on `isMounted`.
8. **Load user metadata reliably (FEED-01)**  
   ‚Äì Confirm kind 0 subscription; add fallback request; ensure avatars fade-in.
9. **Local cache layer for posts (CACHE-01, supports FEED-04)**  
   ‚Äì Use IndexedDB via `idb-keyval` or React Query `persistor`.
10. **Small music fixes**  
    a. Link "Liked Songs" playlist to player context (MUSIC-01).  
    b. Audit player event listeners for duplication (MUSIC-02).
11. **Workout post kcal / intensity (WORKOUT-01)**  
    ‚Äì Add intensity selection UI (1‚Äì10) ‚Üí send with POST payload; adjust server calc.
12. **Optional refinements & polish**  
    ‚Äì Remove manual refresh button entirely after auto-reload + cache proved stable.  
    ‚Äì Implement Service Worker for full offline support.
