## Bug 1 â€“ Save workout to Nostr doesn't work from Dashboard

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Status** | ðŸŸ  Pending investigation |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Description** | Attempting to save a completed workout to Nostr from the Dashboard silently fails; no event is published. |
| **Steps to Reproduce** |
| 1. Complete a workout. <br>2. From the Dashboard, tap **Save to Nostr**. |
| **Expected Behavior** | Workout details are published to the user's configured Nostr relays. |
| **Actual Behavior** | No confirmation; checking relays shows no new event. |
| **Suspected Area(s)** | `services/wallet/`, NIP-29 publishing flow, Dashboard component action handler. |
| **Notes / Hypotheses** | Possibly missing Nostr context in Dashboard route or wrong event object built. |
| **Next Steps** | Confirm handler wiring; add logging; replicate in dev with relay inspector. |

## Bug 2 â€“ "Choose Extras" popup leads to error screen when saving workout

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Status** | ðŸŸ  Pending investigation |
| **Priority** | Medium |

| 1. Complete a workout. <br>2. Tap **Save**. <br>3. Modal appears asking to choose extras. <br>4. Select any option â†’ app errors. |
| **Expected Behavior** | Workout saves without extraneous modal; no crash. |

## Bug 3 â€“ Distance inflates after returning from background

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Status** | ðŸŸ  Pending investigation |
| **Priority** | Critical (affects core tracking) |
| **Description** | While recording a run, if the app is backgrounded and later reopened, the distance jumps aheadâ€”showing more miles than actually run. |
| **Steps to Reproduce** |
| 1. Start run tracking. <br>2. Press home button; keep running. <br>3. After a while, re-open app. |
| **Expected Behavior** | Distance accurately reflects GPS data collected during background period. |
| **Actual Behavior** | Distance overshoots significantly. |
| **Suspected Area(s)** | Background location listener, distance aggregation logic, state persistence on pause/resume. |
| **Notes / Hypotheses** | Possible duplicate GPS samples or missed reset of last coordinate. |
| **Next Steps** | Replicate with debugger; review timestamp filtering when merging background data. |

## Bug 4 â€“ Dashboard mentions claiming rewards (rewards are auto-sent)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Status** | ðŸŸ  Pending investigation |
| **Priority** | Low |
| **Description** | UI copy on Dashboard prompts users to "claim rewards", which is outdatedâ€”the app auto-sends rewards. |
| **Steps to Reproduce** | Open Dashboard after completing runs. |
| **Expected Behavior** | No claim-rewards prompts; maybe show confirmation of auto-sent reward. |
| **Actual Behavior** | Text instructs user to claim. |
| **Suspected Area(s)** | Dashboard component copy. |
| **Next Steps** | Update strings; verify design consensus. |

## Bug 5 â€“ Streaks not shown on Dashboard (only on Stats page)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Status** | ðŸŸ  Pending investigation |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Description** | User's current running streak is visible on Stats page but missing from Dashboard overview card. |
| **Expected Behavior** | Streak indicator should appear on Dashboard for quick glance. |
| **Actual Behavior** | No streak info. |
| **Suspected Area(s)** | Dashboard data selectors, streak context provider. |
| **Next Steps** | Check props flow; reuse Stats component logic. |

## Bug 6 â€“ Rewards popup appears on Stats page despite auto-send

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Status** | ðŸŸ  Pending investigation |
| **Priority** | Low |
| **Description** | Upon opening Stats page, a popup instructs user to claim rewardsâ€”even after rewards are supposed to auto-send (especially since streak achieved). |
| **Steps to Reproduce** | Open Stats page after having an active streak. |
| **Expected Behavior** | No reward claim modal; maybe show toast of reward already delivered. |
| **Actual Behavior** | Modal appears repeatedly. |
| **Suspected Area(s)** | Stats page effect hook, reward notification flag persistence. |
| **Next Steps** | Inspect local storage / state flag controlling modal; ensure cleared post-send. |

## Bug 7 â€“ Rewards were never actually sent

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Status** | ðŸŸ  Pending investigation |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Description** | Despite UI indicating rewards are automatic, no Lightning transaction or on-chain payment was executed. |
| **Steps to Reproduce** | Accumulate eligible reward criteria; monitor wallet. |
| **Expected Behavior** | Reward payment should be broadcast and confirmed. |
| **Actual Behavior** | No payment history. |
| **Suspected Area(s)** | Reward service, Lightning integration, background job trigger. |
