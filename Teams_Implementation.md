## Technical Architecture Questions

### NIP101e Integration
1. **Team Membership**: How do we track membership in NIP101e?
   - Add member pubkeys to existing team event?
   - Create separate membership events?
   - Update team event when members join/leave?

2. **1301 Record Integration**: How do we link workouts to teams/events/challenges?
   - What tags do we add to 1301 records?
   - How do we filter feeds by team/event/challenge?

### Data Structure Questions
1. **Team Events (Kind 33404)**:
   - How do we handle member list updates?
   - Should we store member join dates?
   - How do we handle member removal/leaving?

2. **Event Creation**: 
   - What kind should we use for events? (Kind 33405 proposed)
   - How do we link events to teams?
   - How do we track event participation?

3. **Challenge Creation**:
   - What kind should we use for challenges? (Kind 33403 proposed)
   - How do we differentiate from events?
   - How do we handle challenge rules/goals?

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. **Team Membership Storage**: Should we store the member list in the team event itself, or create separate membership events for each join/leave action?

2. **1301 Integration**: What's the best way to tag 1301 workout records to show team/event/challenge participation without cluttering the records?

3. **Event vs Challenge Distinction**: How should we differentiate between events (captain-created) and challenges (member-created) in the UI and data structure?

4. **Payment Integration**: How do we want to handle the subscription payments? Monthly automatic? Prepaid credits? Lightning recurring payments?

5. **Team Discovery**: How should users discover teams? Tags? Location-based? Activity type filtering?

6. **Data Persistence**: How do we handle team data when the captain goes offline or stops paying? Should teams have expiration dates?

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Debug and fix team detail page loading
2. **Short-term**: Build basic team homepage with member list
3. **Planning**: Finalize NIP101e extensions for events/challenges
4. **Architecture**: Design membership and participation tracking system
