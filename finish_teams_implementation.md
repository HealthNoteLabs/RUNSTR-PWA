### **Mobile-Specific Questions:**
1. **Navigation:** Should team management have its own navigation flow or stay within current structure?
2. **Performance:** Any specific performance targets for team data loading?
3. **Platform Features:** Should we use any mobile-specific features (haptics, notifications, etc.)?

### **Data Questions:**
1. **Challenge Participation:** Store participation in local storage, Nostr events, or both?
2. **Team Analytics:** What metrics should we track and display?
3. **Profile Caching:** How long should we cache profile data?
