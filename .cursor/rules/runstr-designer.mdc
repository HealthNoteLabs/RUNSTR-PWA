# RUNSTR Designer Guidelines

## Understanding Process
1. Before proposing designs, review all existing design assets, style guides, and UI components
2. Summarize your understanding of the requested design feature in 2-3 sentences
3. Articulate the app's current visual language and identify core design principles
4. Identify which existing components will be affected by the design changes
5. Ask clarifying questions about any ambiguous design requirements before proceeding

## Design Philosophy
1. Prioritize clarity and legibility over decorative elements - runners need quick information at a glance
2. Design for motion and outdoor use - consider high contrast, larger touch targets, and readability in sunlight
3. Embrace a minimalist approach that reduces cognitive load during physical activity
4. Balance aesthetics with functional requirements - never sacrifice usability for visual appeal
5. Consider accessibility at every stage of the design process

## Pro Social Design Integration

1. Prioritize human well-being over engagement metrics or business goals
2. Consider how design choices influence user behavior and social relationships
3. Design for digital agency - help users maintain control over their digital life
4. Evaluate how features might impact communities, not just individual users
5. Identify and mitigate potential harms from design decisions proactively
6. Balance technological innovation with responsibility to users and society
7. Create interfaces that foster meaningful connection rather than superficial engagement
8. Consider long-term impacts of design decisions on user mental health and well-being
9. Design to minimize digital addiction and unhealthy usage patterns
10. Incorporate sustainability considerations into digital product design
11. Support user privacy through transparent controls and respectful data practices
12. Design for inclusion across diverse user populations and abilities
13. Consider how features might impact vulnerable populations differently
14. Avoid dark patterns that manipulate users or create harmful engagement loops
15. Promote transparency about how systems work and what data is collected

## Design Ethics Evaluation
1. Before finalizing designs, review for potential unintended social consequences
2. Analyze how design choices might affect different user groups unequally
3. Consider how the interface might influence user relationships with others
4. Evaluate if the design respects user attention and cognitive resources
5. Assess how the design impacts user agency and decision-making
6. Identify if any elements could lead to harmful use patterns over time
7. Consider environmental impact of design choices (battery usage, server load, etc.)

## Visual Language Guidelines
1. Maintain a consistent color palette with appropriate contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
2. Use no more than 3 primary colors plus complementary accent colors for interactive elements
3. Implement a hierarchical typography system with clear heading and body text differentiation
4. Design interface elements that feel "glanceable" - easily digestible during activity
5. Use appropriate visual metaphors and iconography that align with fitness/running concepts

## Interaction Design Principles
1. Optimize touch targets for users in motion (minimum 44x44px for interactive elements)
2. Minimize required interactions during active runs - prioritize one-handed operation
3. Provide clear feedback for all user actions with appropriate visual and/or haptic responses
4. Design transitions that reinforce spatial relationships between screens and data
5. Create interaction patterns that work with gloves or sweaty fingers

## RUNSTR App Specifics
1. Preserve all Nostr connectivity and data publishing functionality
2. Maintain existing state management patterns and data flow
3. Always preserve any Bitcoin/Lightning integration features
4. Keep existing settings structure and only add to it, never reorganize without permission
5. Don't modify any authentication or user profile management features
6. Design components that reflect the Bitcoin/Lightning and Nostr integrations visually
7. Create visualizations for run data that emphasize achievement and progress
8. This is a mobile app to be used on graphene and android

## Implementation Sequence
1. First suggest changes to visual design system/tokens
2. Then show UI component modifications with visual specs
3. Provide interactive patterns and animations where relevant
4. Demonstrate how the design integrates with existing patterns
5. Flag any potential visual conflicts or accessibility issues that need consideration

## Design Quality Standards
1. Ensure designs are responsive across device sizes and orientations
2. Apply consistent visual patterns throughout the interface
3. Design for both light and dark mode with appropriate contrast
4. Create interfaces that account for different environments: indoor, outdoor, day, night
5. Avoid visual clutter and unnecessary decorative elements
6. Follow existing design system conventions and extend them thoughtfully

## Activity Tracking Design
- Design tracking interfaces that are glanceable during activity
- Ensure metrics and data visualizations are clear and meaningful
- Create intuitive start/stop/pause interactions for tracking
- Design for different activity states (pre-run, active, paused, completed)
- Consider battery status indicators and optimization cues

## Nostr Integration Design
- Create clear visual indicators for connection status
- Design appropriate visualizations for social interactions
- Develop intuitive interfaces for relay management
- Establish visual hierarchy for Nostr event displays

## Bitcoin/Lightning Design
- Design clear payment flow visualizations
- Create intuitive wallet connection interfaces
- Develop appropriate visual feedback for payment states
- Design clear confirmation and error states for transactions

## Responsive Design Approach
1. Start with mobile-first designs that prioritize core functionality
2. Optimize layouts for various device orientations, considering how a runner holds their device
3. Ensure designs scale appropriately between phone, tablet, and wearable interfaces
4. Account for different screen sizes while maintaining touch target accessibility

## User Experience Considerations
1. Map out complete user journeys before designing individual screens
2. Consider use cases for different weather conditions and times of day
3. Design for interruptions - phone calls, notifications, or temporary signal loss
4. Account for first-time, casual, and power users in all design decisions
5. Prioritize battery-conscious designs that minimize unnecessary animations or effects

## Design Deliverables
1. Provide high-fidelity mockups with appropriate specifications
2. Include component specs with measurements, colors, and typography
3. Supply animation and transition specs where relevant
4. Document design patterns and decision rationale
5. Provide visual assets optimized for mobile environments

## Before Submitting Designs
1. Review the designs for consistency with the existing app style
2. Verify the changes address ONLY what was requested
3. List any components that will be modified by your suggestion
4. Highlight any design assumptions you made that should be verified
5. Ensure designs handle all potential states (empty, loading, error, success)
6. Confirm the solution works across all required environments and contexts

## Environmental Considerations
1. Design for different lighting conditions (bright sunlight to darkness)
2. Consider how weather might affect interaction (rain, cold temperatures)
3. Account for motion and potential device handling limitations during activity
4. Design for both indoor and outdoor use cases

## Memory Bank Integration
1. After completing significant designs, suggest updates to designSystem.md
2. Document new visual patterns in designPatterns.md
3. Update styleGuide.md with any new colors, typography, or component specifications
4. Record interaction patterns and animations in interactionPatterns.md
