# NWC Implementation Improvements

## Changes Made

We made several key improvements to the RUNSTR app's Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) implementation:

1. **Consolidated Wallet Implementation**: 
   - Removed the redundant `nwcWallet.jsx` implementation
   - Now using only the more robust `AlbyWallet` implementation
   - Eliminated potential conflicts between multiple implementations

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added better error handling throughout the connection process
   - Improved error messages with more detailed information
   - Added proper cleanup for failed connections
   - Enhanced timeout handling for network operations

3. **Enhanced Reconnection Logic**:
   - Prioritized reconnection methods by reliability
   - Added AuthURL tracking for more reliable reconnection
   - Improved connection state management
   - Added additional connection state data

4. **Fixed Payment Processing**:
   - Improved fallback mechanisms for payment failures
   - Added better handling of different wallet implementations
   - Fixed error detection for connection issues
   - Enhanced timeout handling for payment requests

5. **Improved Zap Invoice Generation**:
   - Added multiple relay formats for better compatibility
   - Enhanced fallback mechanisms for unsupported wallet features
   - Improved error handling for zap request failures
   - Added timeout handling for invoice generation

## Benefits

These changes provide several key benefits:

1. **More Reliable Connection**: The application now maintains connections more reliably with better reconnection logic.

2. **Better User Experience**: Improved error messages and handling provide a better user experience when issues occur.

3. **Wider Wallet Compatibility**: Enhanced fallback mechanisms improve compatibility with different NWC wallet implementations.

4. **Simplified Maintenance**: Single wallet implementation makes future updates easier and reduces confusion.

5. **Improved Security**: Better cleanup of failed connections improves security and reduces potential for state leakage.

## Implementation Details

The updated implementation now uses the AlbyWallet class, which incorporates both the NWC and LN clients from the Alby SDK for maximum compatibility and reliability. The NWCWalletConnector component was already using this implementation, and now it's the only implementation in the codebase.

When connecting to a wallet, the application now tries the following methods in order:

1. Direct connection using the saved AuthURL
2. Connection using saved NWC connection string
3. Connection using localStorage values

The implementation also includes better validation of wallet responses, handling of different response formats, and proper timeout handling for all network operations.
